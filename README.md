# Working Idea
RC Car is an a wireless remote-controlled car designed to autonomously navigate and avoid obstacles, ensuring it reaches its destination in the shortest time possible. By using the transmitter and receiver system, the position of the joystick controls are transmitted to the Arduino, which manages the RC car's direction and speed. Specifically, the left joystick is used to regulate the car's speed, allowing for acceleration and deceleration, while the right joystick controls the car's direction, enabling precise steering. The Arduino interprets these joystick movements and translates them into corresponding commands that adjust both the speed and steering of the RC car, ensuring responsive and accurate control.
# Binding of Transmitter and Controller
- Connect the bind cable to the B/VCC port on the receiver.
- Insert power to any other port.
- Hold the bind key while powering on the transmitter to enter bind mode.
- Remove the power and bind cable from the receiver. Then connect the power cable to the B/VCC port.
